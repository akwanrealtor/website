# Express.js Project

This repository contains an empty Express.js application scaffolded with a simple HTTP server.

## Getting Started

1. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```
2. Start the development server with automatic reload:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```
3. Run in production mode:
   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

The server listens on port `3000` by default and responds with a "Hello from Express!" message.
